## ‚ú® Key Features

This HR suite is built around two core modules:

1.  **ü§ñ Resume Screening**: An intelligent assistant that parses resumes, matches candidates to job descriptions, and scores their fit based on skills, experience, and qualifications. This solves the challenge of manually reviewing large volumes of applications for roles like Software Engineer.
2.  **‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Employee Sentiment Analysis**: An analytics pipeline that processes employee feedback (from surveys, exit interviews, etc.) to quantify workforce morale, identify attrition risks, and recommend proactive engagement strategies.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Pipeline Workflow

### Resume Screening Pipeline

1.  **üìÑ Upload**: A recruiter uploads candidate resumes (PDFs) and the corresponding job description through the portal.
2.  **üß† LLM Parsing**: The AI pipeline uses targeted prompts to extract structured metadata (e.g., name, skills, experience, education) from the unstructured text of the resumes and job description.
3.  **üíØ Job Match Scoring**: The LLM compares the extracted resume data against the job requirements and generates a `match_score` for each candidate.
4.  **üìä Dashboard Output**: The recruiter views a dashboard with a ranked list of candidates, their match percentage, parsed data, and a final recommendation.

### Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

1.  **‚úçÔ∏è Feedback Upload**: Employee feedback, either structured or unstructured, is submitted.
2.  **üîç Sentiment Analysis**: The Google Gemini API analyzes the feedback to generate a comprehensive report on emerging risks, key themes, and overall sentiment.
3.  **üìà Strategic Report**: The system produces a report with actionable recommendations for HR and leadership to mitigate risks and improve employee engagement.

## üîë Prompt Engineering

The core of this project lies in precise prompt engineering. Each prompt is designed to instruct the LLM to perform a specific, structured task.

\<details\>
\<summary\>\<strong\>1. analyze\_employee\_sentiment\</strong\>\</summary\>

  * **Use Case**: Performs a comprehensive sentiment analysis on raw employee feedback, transforming it into a strategic markdown report for leadership.

  * **Exact Prompt**:

    ```
    You are an expert HR analyst specializing in employee sentiment and attrition risk.
    Your task is to analyze the following comprehensive employee feedback data and
    generate a strategic report for leadership.

    **Employee Feedback Data:**
    ```

    {feedback\_data\_string}

    ```
    
    **Your strategic report must contain these five sections:**
    1.  **Executive Summary:** A brief, one-paragraph overview of the key findings,
        including overall sentiment and the most critical issue to address.
    2.  **Key Strengths (Top 3):** Identify the top 3 areas where the company is
        performing well. Use bullet points and cite specific question categories as evidence.
    3.  **Critical Areas for Improvement (Top 3):** Identify the top 3 areas that pose the
        biggest risks or have the most negative feedback. Use bullet points and specify the
        themes.
    4.  **Attrition Risk Assessment:** Provide a risk level (Low, Medium, High). Justify the
        assessment by connecting the "Areas for Improvement" directly to factors that cause
        employees to leave.
    5.  **Actionable Recommendations:** For each "Area for Improvement" you identified,
        propose one specific, concrete, and actionable recommendation that HR and leadership
        can implement.

    Structure the output clearly with markdown headings for each section.

    structured JSON object. Extract: `contact_info` (name, email, linkedin_url), `summary`,
    `total_experience_years`, `work_experience` (list of jobs), `education` (list of
    qualifications), `skills`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

1.  **Handling Non-Textual PDFs**:

      * **Problem**: Some resumes are image-based (e.g., scanned documents) and cannot be parsed directly by an LLM.
      * **Solution**: An **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** pipeline was implemented as a pre-processing step to convert image-based PDFs into machine-readable text, ensuring all documents are accessible for evaluation.

2.  **Normalization of Unstructured Data**:

      * **Problem**: Job descriptions and resumes often have inconsistent formatting, which can hinder accurate analysis.
      * **Solution**: The LLM is used in a preliminary step to parse and standardize these documents into a predefined, consistent JSON format before the primary evaluation, creating a uniform data structure.

3.  **Prompt Engineering for Accuracy**:

      * **Problem**: Ambiguous prompts can lead to irrelevant or incorrect LLM outputs, compromising the system's reliability.
      * **Solution**: Prompts were engineered to be concise, specific, and context-aware, minimizing the risk of misinterpretation by the LLM and optimizing the use of its context window.
